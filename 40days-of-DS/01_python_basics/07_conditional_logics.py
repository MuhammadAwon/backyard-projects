# Logical operators are either "true or false" or "yes or no" or "0 or 1"
# equal to                       ==
# not equal to                   !=
# less than                      <
# greater than                   >
# less than and equal to         <=
# greater than and equal to      >=

# # Is 4 equal to 4?
# print(4==4)
# print(4!=4)
# print(4>3)
# print(3>6)

# # Application of logical operators
