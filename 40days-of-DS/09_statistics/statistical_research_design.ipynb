    "# Factorial Research Design\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an experiment design that is used to study two or more factors (independent variables), each with multiple discrete possible values or levels. For example, a research about how effective a new drug is on **migraine attacks** amongst **gender**. In order to test the efficiency of the drug we could create three conditions for difference in the dosage of drug **low, medium, and high**. This would be consider as 3x2 factorial design, where **migranie attacks and gender** are dependent variables and **variations in drug dosage** are independent variables respectively. We could then investigate our hypothesis about the effect of drug in gender."
