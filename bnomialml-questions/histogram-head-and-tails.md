# Histogram head and tails

We are trying to predict the price of a car.

Our company has a website where users sell and buy used cars. Deciding how much we should charge for a used car is complicated and error-prone.

We want to build an automatic price recommendation system.

The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of the car is our target variable. To check its distribution, we plot its histogram.

**Which of the following statements is true about the distribution plot of our target variable?**

- [x] The head of the distribution is a range where many of the values are concentrated.
- [ ] The head of the distribution is the area where values fall right at the center of the histogram.
- [x] The tail of the distribution is the part of the histogram that tapers off on one side.
- [x] A long tail is an area where many values are spread far from the head.

## Answer!

[Here is what a histogram looks like.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram)

The head of the distribution is the area where most of the values are concentrated. This makes the first choice correct and the second choice incorrect.

The distribution's tails are the areas of the graph that start tapering off. A long-tail happens when many values are spread far from the head of the distribution. [Here is an example of a long tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#/media/File:Tips-histogram2.png).

Therefore, the only incorrect choice for this question is the second one.
