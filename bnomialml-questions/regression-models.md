# A few regression models to start

Regression analysis is a Supervised Learning technique that investigates the relationship between a continuous target variable based one the value of one or multiple predictor variables.

We have access to many regression models with slightly different characteristics but the same overall purpose in machine learning.

The team knew that.

After studying the problem before them for a few days, they knew they needed to select a few regression models to start experimenting.

**Which of the following are regression models that the team could consider to start their exploration phase?

- [x] Linear Regression
- [x] Ploynomila Regression
- [x] Ridge Regression
- [x] Lasso Regression

## Let's take a look at the answer.

The short answer is that every one of these methods is a regression technique the team could use.

Other than knowing that we need to predict a continuous target, we don't have any specific information about this problem. Therefore we can't discard any of the provided choices.
