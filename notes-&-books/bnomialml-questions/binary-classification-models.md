# 20,000 sunny and cloudy samples

Today is your very first day.

You get access to weather data. Twenty thousand samples with the weather of sunny and cloudy days. You want to build a model to predict whether a future day will be sunny or cloudy.

You already know this is a binary classification problem, and now it's time to pick a model.

**Which of the following techniques can you use to build a binary classification model?**

- [x] Logistic Regression
- [x] k-Nearest Neighbors
- [x] Neural Networks
- [x] Decision Trees

## Answer

The four choices are examples of supervised learning techniques that you could use to build a binary classification model.

Although they all work in theory, they are very different approaches, and some might lead to better results on this dataset than others.

However, the problem doesn't give us any information about the characteristics of the data, so it's hard to disqualify any of the choices based on what we know.

Therefore, every choice is a correct answer.
