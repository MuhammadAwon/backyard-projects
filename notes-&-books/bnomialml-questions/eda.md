# Exploring data before anything else

An essential step in any machine learning project is the Exploratory Data Analysis process.

Before we can train a model, we need to understand our data. As the name suggests, Exploratory Data Analysis allows us to explore the data to discover potential problems or patterns that we can use.

**Which of the following are some of the steps we take during this process?**

- [x] Learn the distribution of the target variable.
- [ ] Understand the features in the dataset and the distribution of their values.
- [x] Evaluate the performance of our models on this data.
- [x] Assess the data quality, including missing or corrupt values.

## Answer

Exploratory Data Analysis is a process that happens before we have a model. It's precisely the step that helps us create that model.

We focus on learning as much as we can about the data during this process. Here are some examples of activities that happen at this time:

- Investigate the dataset to discover valuable patterns.
- Spot any potential anomalies that may exist in the data.
- Use statistics and plots to test different hypotheses and check assumptions.
- Understand the distribution of the variable that we are trying to predict â€”the target variable.
- Determine whether there are missing or corrupt values in the data.

Exploratory Data Analysis doesn't include building a model, so the third choice is incorrect. We can't possibly evaluate a model that doesn't exist at this time.

All the other three choices are correct.
