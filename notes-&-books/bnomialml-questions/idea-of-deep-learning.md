# The ideas behind Deep Learning aren't new

Over the last few years, Deep Learning has become very popular.

But you know what's wild? Many of the core ideas we use today in Deep Learning were already around in the '90s!

We had the raw materials back then, but the conditions weren't adequate for it to explode.

**Which of the following do you think likely caused Deep Learning to gain so much popularity?**

- [x] The gaming industry's massive investment in developing fast, parallel chips.
- [ ] The amount of positive press at the beginning of the latest AI Winter brought new investment into the field.
- [x] The proliferation of the Internet, allowing the collection and distribution of massive amounts of data.
- [x] The development and improvement of algorithms, making possible the training of deep networks.

## Answer!

In Deep Learning with Python, Second Edition, FranÃ§ois Chollet writes:
> (...) typical deep learning models used in computer vision or speech recognition require orders of magnitude more computational power than your laptop can deliver. Throughout the 2000s, companies like NVIDIA and AMD invested billions of dollars in developing fast, massively parallel chips (graphical processing units, or GPUs) to power the graphics of increasingly photorealistic video games (...)

This investment massively benefitted the development of deep learning: we found ourselves with as much computing power as we ever needed.

As with many other things, the Internet has played a fundamental role in popularizing deep learning. Thanks to it, we have collected and distributed the data we use to power these algorithms. Therefore, the third choice is also correct.

Also, a few important algorithmic improvements allowed the community to start training deep neural networks reliably. Again, from Deep Learning with Python, Second Edition:
> * Better activation functions for neural layers
> * Better weight-initialization schemes 
> * Better optimization schemes

This makes the fourth choice also correct.

Finally, the second choice argues about "positive press at the beginning of the latest AI Winter" which is incorrect. The AI Winter is a period of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence, and "positive press" wasn't part of the equation.

In summary, every choice except the second one is correct.
