# The black sheep

Here you have a list containing three popular deep learning architectures.

But there's one black sheep. One of these is not a deep learning architecture.

**Can you determine which of the following doesn't belong on this list?**

- [x] ImageNet
- [] AlexNet
- [] GoogleNet
- [] VGG16

## Answer

While **AlexNet**, **GoogleNet**, and **VGG16** are deep learning architectures, **ImageNet** is an image database with millions of images, so it has nothing to do with the rest.

The first choice is the correct answer.
