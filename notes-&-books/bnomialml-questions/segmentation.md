# Ted wants to sell more cars

Ted is just starting his first job.

He is working at a major car dealership. Hundreds of cars go out the door every month, and Ted plans to help the company understand their customers a little bit more.

After a week of obsessing over all the information they capture about every customer, Ted starts thinking about a good way to slice them into segments based on their characteristics.

The problem is that Ted is unsure about the best approach. Should he segment customers based on their purchase history, or should it be better to do it by age? What about the type of vehicle or purchase power?

**How would you approach this problem if you were in Ted's shoes?**

- [x] Use an unsupervised learning algorithm to produce potentially interesting ways to segment the customers.
- [ ] Define beforehand a few segments, and train a supervised learning algorithm to classify every customer into one of them.
- [ ] Use a supervised learning algorithm to produce potentially interesting ways to segment the customers.
- [ ] Use a semi-supervised learning algorithm to process the data, thus taking advantage of both supervised and unsupervised techniques.

## Answer

Customer segmentation is a popular field where you try to find similar characteristics among your customers.

There are always multiple ways to solve a problem, but customer segmentation is a perfect opportunity to use unsupervised learning techniques.

It's hard to identify customer segments manually. You don't know the patterns in the data beforehand, so creating specific groups or segments will hardly be the right approach. Instead, a clustering algorithm will be faster, more scalable, and will give you better results.

The first choice is the correct answer to this question, while the other three ask for supervised and semi-supervised learning methods that aren't the best approach.
