# Only one hidden layer

Sarah wants to add a few slides about neural networks as part of a new course she's been working on for the past month.

Most of her students don't have a machine learning background, so Sarah wants to ensure she uses accurate and simple language during her presentation to avoid confusing them.

She plans to show an example of how a neural network with a single hidden layer works, but she is having difficulty choosing the right way to refer to this model.

**Which of the following is the correct way to talk about a neural network with a single hidden layer?**

- [ ] A deep neural network
- [ ] A recurrent neural network
- [ ] A hidden neural network
- [x] A shallow neural network

## Answer

We refer to neural networks that use a few hidden layers between the input and output as "shallow neural networks." There's no specific number for how many hidden layers is too many, but one single layer makes Sarah's model a shallow network.

A deep neural network consists of multiple layers between the input and output layers. The more layers we add, the "deeper" the network becomes.

The term "hidden neural network" doesn't exist, and while recurrent neural networks exist, Sarah's network is not one of them.
