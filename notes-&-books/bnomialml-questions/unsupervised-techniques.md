# One of these shouldn't be here

Here are four different techniques commonly used in machine learning.

Although they are all related somehow, one of them is different from the rest. Your goal is to determine which of the following doesn't belong on this list.

**Can you select the odd one out?**

- [ ] Expectation–Maximization
- [x] PCA
- [ ] DBSCAN
- [ ] K-Means

## Answer

These four are examples of unsupervised learning techniques, but `Expectation-Maximization`, `DBSCAN`, and `K-Means` are either clustering algorithms or used for that purpose while `PCA` is not.

PCA—short for Principal Component Analysis—is a dimensionality reduction algorithm that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets. Basically, PCA reduces the number of variables in a dataset while preserving as much information as possible.

The second choice is the correct answer to this question.
