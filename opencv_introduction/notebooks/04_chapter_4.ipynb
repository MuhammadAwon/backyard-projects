    "\n",
    "Then, for each pixel of the gray scale image, if its value is lesser than the threshold, then we assign to it the value 0 (black). Otherwise, we assign to it the value 255 (white)."

    "Note that since we are operating over a gray scale image, pixel values vary between 0 and 255. Also, since we want to convert the image to black and white, when the pixel is greater than the threshold, the value to which we want it to be converted is 255.\n",

    "As third input, the function receives the user defined value to which a pixel should be converted in case its value is greater than the threshold. We will use the value 255, which corresponds to white. Recall that we want to convert the image to black and white, which means that at the end we want a image having pixels with either the value 0 or 255.\n",

    "As fourth input, the function receives a constant indicating the type of thesholding to apply. As already mentioned, we are going to use a binary threshold, so we pass the value **THRESH_BINARY**.\n",
